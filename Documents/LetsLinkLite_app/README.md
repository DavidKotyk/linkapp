# LetsLinkLite

## Overview
LetsLinkLite is a SwiftUI-based social events app that displays local events on a map, provides event details, and enables in-app chat and user profiles.

## Components
- iOS App (SwiftUI): Handles UI, navigation, map, chat, profiles, and local sample data injection.
- ScraperAgent (Python): Headless browser scripts for scraping live event and venue data from web sources, with geocoding and NLP parsing.

## Getting Started
### iOS App
1. Open `LetsLinkLite/LetsLinkLite.xcodeproj` in Xcode (iOSÂ 17+).
2. Build & Run on simulator or device.
3. Explore the Events map, create events, chat, and profiles.

### ScraperAgent
```bash
cd ScraperAgent
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
playwright install
python scraper_agent.py "San Francisco"
```

## Project Status
- Done: Cleaned project structure, map & chat UI, profile UI, sample data loader, scraping agent skeleton.
- Next: Extend scrapers for real sites, integrate live data into the app, implement missing flows (report, follow, join), add persistence and real messaging.
